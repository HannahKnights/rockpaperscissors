Rock Paper Scissors
========

### Rock Paper Scissors app

This simple app recreates the rules of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock from the [Big Bang Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock). It was set as a project to introduce using and testing Javascript. The simple programme was written firstly in Ruby and tested with RSpec, we then went on to re-write it in JavaScript and test it with Jasmine.

Created while studying at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com)
